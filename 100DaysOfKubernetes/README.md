# 100 Days of Kubernetes

Welcome to my **100 Days of Kubernetes** journey! This repository serves as a public record of my daily progress and aspirations as I dive into the world of **Kubernetes**. 

## Why 100 days?

I have observed that my current approach to learning has been somewhat informal and lacks comprehensiveness. Despite having numerous operational services in place and a solid understanding of the communication dynamics among applications, microservices, and endpoints, I often encounter challenges when delving into more advanced topics. 

## Goals and Aspirations

My strategic plan involves initiating a comprehensive learning journey, beginning with foundational concepts. This approach aims to systematically construct a robust knowledge base, enabling me to adeptly construct, manage, and flourish within my home ecosystem. Additionally, it positions me to address and overcome specific challenges encountered in my professional endeavors.

### Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes has become a cornerstone in modern container orchestration and cloud-native development. Through this **100-day journey**, my primary goals are:

1. **Master Kubernetes Concepts:**
   - Gain a deep understanding of Kubernetes architecture, components, and concepts.
   - Explore Kubernetes resources such as Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

2. **Hands-On Experience:**
   - Work on practical exercises and real-world scenarios to build hands-on experience with Kubernetes.
   - Create and manage Kubernetes clusters, deploying applications in a scalable and resilient manner.

3. **DevOps Integration:**
   - Integrate Kubernetes into my DevOps workflow.
   - Explore CI/CD pipelines for deploying and updating applications on Kubernetes clusters.

4. **Security and Best Practices:**
   - Learn and implement security best practices for Kubernetes clusters.
   - Understand RBAC, Pod Security Policies, and network policies.

5. **Explore Ecosystem Tools:**
   - Explore and use tools and projects in the Kubernetes ecosystem, such as Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana.
   - Gain insights into monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting in a Kubernetes environment.

6. **Kubernetes Networking:**
   - Understand Kubernetes networking concepts and configurations.
   - Explore service discovery, load balancing, and network policies.

### Daily Progress

Throughout this journey, I will document my daily progress, challenges faced, and the skills acquired. Each day, I will strive to achieve specific milestones that contribute to my overarching goals.
