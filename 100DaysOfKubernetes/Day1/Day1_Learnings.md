# Study Log - Day 1

## Date: [Jan 22, 2024]

### Today's Goals

- [x] Goal 1: Get an understanding of the basic architecture
  - [x] Sub Goal 1: Namespaces, Pods, Deployments
  - [x] Sub Goal 2: Kubernetes Nodes description and identificaiton
- [x] Goal 2: Get some examples of configurations (simple)
  - [x] Sub Goal 1: Pods
  - [x] Sub Goal 2: Deployments
  - [x] Sub Goal 3: Namespaces 

### Progress Overview
**Description**: Learned about the architecture, node types, differences between these types, and tasks. In addition, understanding of pods, containers, and how they differ, different types of isolation, and how microservices on a worker communicate between other services across nodes.

### Skills Acquired

- **Skill 1:**
  - Understood the yaml implementations of both pods and deployments
  - [Pods](./Examples/example-pod.yaml) and [Deployments](./Examples/example-depoyment.yaml)

### Challenges Faced

- **No challenges today**
  - This is due to my previous knowlege.

### Resources Used

List the resources consulted or used during study. Including: online tutorials, documentation, books, or any other reference materials.

- **Resource 1:**
  - [What is Kubernetes | TechWorld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnvRFRk_51k) Nara describes what kubernetes is and how it works. Explaining multiple different areas.
- **Resource 2:**
  - [100 Day of Kubernetes](https://100daysofkubernetes.io/start/intro-to-k8s.html) Provides a high level description of kuberenetes and notes with resources
- **Resource 3:**
  - [CKA: Certified Kubernetes Administrator](ertified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests) Perparation for the CKA certification.


### Plan for Tomorrow

Outline next steps for the next study session. Include specific goals, topics, or tasks to be focused on in the next day's session.

- [ ] Goal 1: I would like to have a better understanding of the yaml syntax, how it works, and how it can be leveraged into a efficent model.
- [ ] Goal 2: Continue to grow my fundanmentals.

### Reflection

I felt like sticking to the documentation of K8s and reviewing was good, but did not want to get stuck in the rabbit hole of specific links that, although interesting, are not as useful.

### Additional Notes

So far this has worked, its only been 2 days, but its been good. I hope this continues going forward.
