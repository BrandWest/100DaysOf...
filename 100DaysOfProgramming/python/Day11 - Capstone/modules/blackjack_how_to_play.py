        $$  1. The goal is to have your cards less than or equal to 21.   $$
        $$  2. Aces count for 1 or 11.                                    $$
        $$  3. King, Queen, and Jack all count as 10.                     $$
        $$  4. Type 'hit' to get another card.                            $$
        $$  5. Type 'stay' to hold onto your current cards.               $$
        $$  6. If you get 21, you bust and lose.                          $$
        $$  7. If the dealer ends up with more than you, you lose.        $$
        $$  8. If you have 21 or less, and more than the dealer, you win. $$
